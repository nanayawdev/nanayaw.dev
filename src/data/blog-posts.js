    content: "A couple of months ago, I started training a new employee. The person really wanted to get into programming, so we talked. He has a talent for learning, can remember algorithmic tricks, and, most importantly, is persistent.Only for now, he is sure that if he studies a little more, he will become a super-specialist who raises money. And when, during another call, it turns out that he needs to read a couple dozen pages of documentation to master the necessary technology, he immediately starts whining — “Do I have to read and memorize all day again? And when will I work?” I listen to him and don't want to disappoint him. I have been programming for 17 years, and I have to read documentation and books regularly for several hours a week. This is the nature of programming, computer science, and most likely any intellectual work. You will always catch up with this technological locomotive. Every day new frameworks, convenient services and useful recipes are released. You can’t keep track of all this, you can only be content with small crumbs that you manage to absorb between deadlines, sleepless nights, and you still need to have time to live."
